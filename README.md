# filter
program that applies filters to BMPs

Specification
Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, reflection, blur, or edge detection filters to their images.
	 The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
	 The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
	 The blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
	 The edges function should take an image and highlight the edges between objects, according to the Sobel operator.
You should not modify any of the function signatures, nor should you modify any other files other than helpers.c.
